## v1.14.0 - 17 October 2019

### Features

- [Service icon](/#/base/service-icon) have had a big update. They are no longer deprecated as a whole within KPN Style. Instead, we are going to move towards supporting all of the Service Icons provided by KPN UX Lab. They have all been added. As to not break backward compatibility, we have taken two measures: we kept the prefix `si-` instead of `service-` and all of the "old" icon names are still supported (albeit deprecated).
- Internal: added StyleLint to our own project to maintain high code quality as we move forward with the collaborative maintenance of KPN Style. Some refactors have been made that will not impact the output to comply fully with the linting rules.
- Internal: TypeScript support has been added within KPN Style to prepare for future functionalities. Corresponding linting rules have also been added.
